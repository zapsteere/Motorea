He had good knowledge and was open and honest about everything, which made me confident I was getting what I was looking for. I'm writing this the day after buying the car and having driven from one side of London to the other and back again I can honestly say the car was well worth the money and is in excellent condition. The sale was smooth and everything was explained well (even some of the things I'd forgotten to ask). I would recommend anyone looking for their next car to give Suleiman a call, I'm glad I did.Motorea Ltd",
